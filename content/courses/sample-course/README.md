# PAPI is AWESOME!

This directory contains a template structure for creating new courses on Dot Code School. You can use this as a starting point for your own courses.

## How to Use This Template

### Option 1: Using the Helper Script

1. Navigate to the `course-template` directory in your terminal
2. Run the helper script with your desired course slug:
   ```
   ./create-course.sh your-course-slug
   ```
3. The script will create a new course directory with the proper structure
4. Follow the instructions provided by the script to customize your course

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. Copy this entire `course-template` directory to create your new course
2. Rename the directory to your course slug (e.g., `javascript-basics`)
3. Rename `course-template.mdx` to match your course slug (e.g., `javascript-basics.mdx`)
4. Edit the course metadata and content in the renamed file
5. Customize the sections and lessons to fit your course content
6. Update all placeholder text (marked with `[brackets]`) with your actual content

## Template Structure

        ├── core-concepts.mdx     # Section metadata
        └── lessons/              # Container for lessons in this section
            └── variables/        # Lesson example with template/solution
                ├── variables.mdx # Lesson content
                └── files/        # Code files for the lesson
                    ├── template/ # Files with TODOs for learners
                    │   └── variables.js  # Example template file
                    └── solution/ # Completed files for reference
                        └── variables.js  # Example solution file
```

## File Types

This template demonstrates two patterns for including code files in your lessons:

1. **Source Directory**: Used in the `setup-environment` lesson to show the final state of files after an action is taken, without requiring the learner to implement anything themselves.

2. **Template/Solution Directories**: Used in the `variables` lesson to provide both a starting point with TODOs (template) and a completed implementation (solution) for hands-on exercises.

Choose the appropriate pattern based on the goals of each lesson.

## Customization

Feel free to add more sections and lessons as needed for your course. You can also customize the structure to better fit your specific content, but try to maintain the general organization pattern for consistency across courses.
