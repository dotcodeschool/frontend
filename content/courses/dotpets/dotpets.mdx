DotPets is a tamagotchi-style on-chain pet game built using Polkadot Asset Hub and Polkadot-API.

It is a fun, lightweight entry point into Web3 frontend development that teaches fundamentals like wallet connection, on-chain state, identity, and asset minting using Polkadot’s Asset Hub + Polkadot-API.
